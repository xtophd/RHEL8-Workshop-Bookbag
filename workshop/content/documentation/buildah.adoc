= Container Dev with with Buildah and Skopeo

In this unit, we will get familiar with Buildah and Skopeo.  

NOTE: These exercises are an extension of the `podman` unit and although not required, it is strongly encourage that you complete that unit first.

== Additional Reference Materials


NOTE: You are not required to reference any additional resources for these exercises.  This is informational only.

    * link:https://linuxhandbook.com/buildah-basics/[Getting Started with Buildah - Servesha]

== Getting Started

From workstation.example.com, you should be able to ssh to node3.example.com as 'root' without any prompts for credentials.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
ssh node3.example.com
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
cheat-buildah-checkhost.sh
----

Now you are ready to extend your knowledge of containers with buildah and skopeo.

== Build an Image With Buildah

=== Web Server Version 2.0

In the previous lab on `podman`, we pulled down the ubi image and used an OCIFile to build a "webserver" container image. That process used `buildah` under the hood, but in this lab we are going to use `buildah` directly to create a similar image manually.

==== Start a Fresh Build

Let's get started by creating a new working container based off of the ubi image.

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
buildah from ubi8/ubi
----

.Your output should look like this
[source]
----
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob befb03b11956 done
Copying blob ee2244abc66f done
Copying config 8121a9f530 done
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
ubi-working-container
----

This gives us the name of the "working container" and it is this container image that we will modify with buildah.

==== Add a Custom File

Let's run:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
echo "Every time you run setenforce 0, you make Dan Walsh weep." > /root/dan-cries.txt

buildah copy ubi-working-container /root/dan-cries.txt /var/www/html/
----

At this point, you have copied your local `dan-cries.txt` into the the ubi-working-container image.

You should see feedback similar to:

----
34f1621a22ffd90a2ebbd58eba315089dc2704ac69a3d33d60362422e4ec26a1
----

The steps you performed above is equivalent to the following OCIFile (or Dockerfile):

----
FROM ubi8/ubi
COPY /root/dan-cries.txt /var/www/html/
----

So it's nice that we can do that with buildah, manually.

But wait there's more!!!

==== Install Packages

We need to install an httpd server in our image, and what better way to do that than a simple `yum install`.

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
buildah run ubi-working-container yum install -y httpd
----

==== Configure the Entry Point

Next we set the entry point (command) so when the image deploys it knows what process to launch.

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
buildah config --cmd "/usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND" ubi-working-container
----

==== Mount the Container Image

Now let us continue to explore and make additional cutomizations to our image.

Proceed to mount the root filesystem of your container with:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
buildah mount ubi-working-container
----

You should see output similar to:

[source]
----
/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/3456a159b5b3c9e3056d14b97bde1f0e770500dd1cdd6168c894a52a3b3f12ee/merged
----

Using the long path provided by your mount command, change directories.

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
cd /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/3456a159b5b3c9e3056d14b97bde1f0e770500dd1cdd6168c894a52a3b3f12ee/merged
ls -lah ./var/www/html
----

and you should see:

----
total 16K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4.0K Apr 12 21:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root 4.0K Apr 12 21:12 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root   58 Apr 12 21:12 dan-cries.txt
----

There is our `dan-cries.txt`! Let's add an additional file: ./var/www/html/index.html:

----
<html>
<title>Stop Disabling SELinux</title>
<body>
<p>
Seriously, stop disabling SELinux. Learn how to use it before you blindly shut it off.
</p>
</body>
</html>
----

Once you have written that, you should be able to run:

.[root@node3 merged]#
----
ls -lahZ ./var/www/html/
----

and see:

----
total 20K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0:c60,c544 4.0K Apr 12 21:25 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0:c60,c544 4.0K Apr 12 21:12 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0:c60,c544   58 Apr 12 21:12 dan-cries.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0:c60,c544  164 Apr 12 21:24 index.html
----

When you are done making direct changes to the root filesystem of your container, you can run:

.[root@node3 merged]#
----
cd /root
buildah unmount ubi-working-container
----

You should see output similar to:
----
e918debcaabb5820997b1a4969fbd45284adc0a2869d1f22a1bce78f703ff3c6
----

==== Commit Changes to New Image

At this point, we've used buildah to run commands and create a container image similar to those in the OCIFile used in the `podman` unit.  Go ahead and commit the working container in to an actual container image:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
buildah commit ubi-working-container webserver2
----

You should see output similar to:

[source]
----
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob d3ada5af5602 skipped: already exists
Copying blob 668db11eda93 skipped: already exists
Copying blob 0f75b7e04ec6 done

Storing signatures
a831badcea41e924fd4a37f98431702142c17a64d06bd5444ac4471c1285be50
----

Let's look at our images:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
podman images
----

You should see:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY                            TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
localhost/webserver2                  latest   a831badcea41   25 seconds ago   240 MB
registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi   latest   8121a9f5303b   12 days ago      240 MB
----

==== Deploy

Now let's run that webserver:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
podman run -d -p 8080:80 webserver2
----

==== Validate

Finally let's test our new webserver:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/
----

returns:

[source]
----
<html>
<title>Stop Disabling SELinux</title>
<body>
<p>
Seriously, stop disabling SELinux. Learn how to use it before you blindly shut i
t off.
</p>
</body>
</html>
----

and:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
curl http://localhost:8080/dan-cries.txt
----

returns:

[source]
----
Every time you run setenforce 0, you make Dan Walsh weep.
----

As you can see, all of the changes we made with buildah are active and working in this new container image!




== Inspecting Images with Skopeo

Let's take a look at the webserver2:latest container that we just built:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
skopeo inspect containers-storage:localhost/webserver2:latest
----

This should show us output similar to:

[source]
----

        "version": "8.1"
    },
    "Architecture": "amd64",
    "Os": "linux",
    "Layers": [
        "sha256:d3ada5af5602bd0da378e4f0144f8fe8bdbe3f5a65f367dd9ebe759756bada68",

    ]
}
----

We will see that this container is based on the Red Hat UBI image. 

Let's look at the ubi8/ubi container that we built this off of and compare the layers section:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
skopeo inspect containers-storage:registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
----

The output of this should be similar to:

----
{
    "Name": "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi",
    "Digest": "sha256:f6648a87c8c52099bacd19b112beb3b65407ae6d3441f9b559ba53c4112c57a4",

        "vcs-type": "git",
        "vendor": "Red Hat, Inc.",
        "version": "8.1"
    },
    "Architecture": "amd64",
    "Os": "linux",
    "Layers": [
        "sha256:ee2244abc66ff9c6a4bf50fe19041fec82a95c87d18ee3a3660368cb274927c7",
        "sha256:befb03b11956169cf23096fc58081ca35034a6545fc37d63605bf0d200fe5eda"
    ]
}
----

Comparing the layers section, we can see that our container has 3 layers whereas the original container only has 2 layers. In this, we can tell that there are differences between these containers.

Pretty neat that we can look inside local containers, but what about containers that are in registries? Skopeo can inspect containers on remote registries without the need to pull the image locally. Let's give that a test:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
skopeo inspect docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:latest
----

The above allows us to look at the registry's copy of ubi8/ubi and will return this output:

----

Let's run:

NOTE: If you are more curious and would like to inspect the details a little further you could pipe the output to `more` or `less` and page through the archive contents.  `tar tvzf b26afdf22be4e9c30220796780a297b91549a3b3041b6fdcbda71bf48a6912e7 | less`

The other two numeric files provided in the image download are:

  * a copy of the metadata in text 
  * an additional tarball of any container secrets
  
Lastly, a couple of ASCII text files:

  * oci config info used to build the container
  * version info
  * manifest info

=== Other Uses of Skopeo

Skopeo can also do the following things:

  * Copy an image (manifest, filesystem layers, signatures) from one location to another. It can convert between manifest types in doing this (oci, v2s1, v2s2)
  * Delete images from registries that you have admin rights to.
  * Push images to registries that you have push rights to.

Examples of how to do these things are available in 'man skopeo'

=== Cleanup
