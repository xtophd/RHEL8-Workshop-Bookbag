= Kernel Live Patching - Plan your reboots!

Red Hat Enterprise Linux offers kernel live patching, a solution to patch your running kernel without rebooting or restarting any processes. In this lab, we'll explore this solution, which ships in the form of "kpatches" that can be managed with the "kpatch" tool.

== Getting Started


There is a dedicated VM we will use for the container exercises. From workstation.example.com, you should be able to ssh to node2.example.com as 'root' without any prompts for credentials.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
ssh node2.example.com
----


== Installing a kpatch

Let's start by looking at the current kernel version:

.[root@node2 ~]# rpm -q kernel
----
kernel-4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64
----

.[root@node2 ~]# uname -r
----
4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64
----

Here we can see that we are running the 4.18.0-147 kernel. Now we install all kpatches for our kernel:

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
yum install "kpatch-patch = $(uname -r)" -y
----
Output should look similar to:
----
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
...
----

Note that kpatches are cumulative, so you cannot pick and choose a specific set of patches. You must take all fixes shipped by kpatches. At this time, kpatches are limited to security vulnerabilities. For a list of which kpatches are available and which vulnerabilities they address by CVE, please see: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/4499631>

Further, if you'd like to look at which CVEs are included by the kpatch installed on the system, you can do:

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
rpm -qi --changelog kpatch-patch-4_18_0-147
----

and you will get output similar to:

----
Name        : kpatch-patch-4_18_0-147
Version     : 1
Release     : 4.el8
Architecture: x86_64
Install Date: Wed 26 Feb 2020 08:43:23 PM EST

----

This tells us that we are now protected against CVE-2018-12207 and CVE-2019-11135. Let's check `kpatch list`:

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
kpatch list
----

Output should look like:
----
Loaded patch modules:
kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 [enabled]

Installed patch modules:
kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 (4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64)
----

We can see that we have kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 now installed and loaded. We have these protections effective immediately and without having to reboot. We can now schedule a reboot for a time that is convenient for us. 

== Taking that Scheduled Reboot

Since we're in a lab environment, let's go ahead and reboot this node. Due to a bug in this environment, please use `init 6` as directed. Do not use any other reboot methods!

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
init 6
----

When the machine comes back up, we can run `kpatch list` again and see that our kpatches have persisted through the reboot, so we are still protected.

.[root@workstation ~]# 
----
ssh node2
----

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
kpatch list
----

Output should look like:
----
Loaded patch modules:
kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 [enabled]

Installed patch modules:
kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 (4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64)
----

Now, let's actually update the kernel and reboot:

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
yum update kernel -y
----

Output should look similar to:
----
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
...
----

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
rpm -q kernel
----

Output should look like:
----
kernel-4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64
kernel-4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.x86_64
----

We see now that we have the updated kernel. Let's look at the output of `kpatch list`:

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
kpatch list
----

Output should look like:
----
Loaded patch modules:
kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 [enabled]

Installed patch modules:
kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 (4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64)
----

Everything looks as expected here. Let's reboot. Due to a bug in this environment, please use `init 6` as directed. Do not use any other reboot methods!

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
init 6
----

Upon reboot, we can see that we are running the latest kernel:

.[root@workstation ~]# 
----
ssh node2
----

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
rpm -q kernel
----

Output should look like:
----
kernel-4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64
kernel-4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.x86_64
----

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
uname -r
----

Output should look like:
----
4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.x86_64
----

If we do `kpatch list` again, we will see that there are no loaded patch modules, but we do still have the kpatches for 4.18.0-147 installed. These can be removed if desired.

.[root@node2 ~]# 
----
kpatch list
----

Output should look like:
----
Loaded patch modules:

Installed patch modules:
kpatch_4_18_0_147_1_4 (4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64)
----
