= Introduction to systemd

== Overview

Systemd is the "init" system for RHEL 8 (and 7 for that matter).  It replaces Upstart, the SysV "init" system used in prior releases of RHEL.  Systemd is more than just a facility to bring up user space, it is a system manager that offers:

  * service parallelization
  * socket and D-Bus activation
  * on-demand starting of services
  * track services and child processes via cgroups
  * and much more

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node1` as user `root`.

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node1`.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *ssh node1*
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your priviledges.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo -i*
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *workshop-systemd-checkhost.sh*
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Analyzing System Startup

Let's collect some initial data about the boot process

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemd-analyze*

Startup finished in 3.783s (kernel) + 6.526s (initrd) + 14.723s (userspace) = 25.033s
multi-user.target reached after 10.540s in userspace
----

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemd-analyze blame*

          4.205s kdump.service
          3.308s firewalld.service
          3.108s dnf-makecache.service
          2.991s NetworkManager-wait-online.service
          2.182s dracut-initqueue.service
          1.562s sssd.service
          ...<output truncated>...
----

This command prints a list of all running units, ordered by the time they took to initialize.  To streamline the boot process for something like a cloud image, this helps to learn the “cost” of some of the default services.  Unnecessary services could potentially be removed or disabled to speed boot time.

== Core Concepts

=== Units

The fundamental building block that systemd manages is called a "unit".  A "unit" can describe different types of objects, but the most common type is a "service".  

A "unit file" is the configuration file that describes a unit and tells systemd what dependencies exist and how to start, stop and monitor the object.

"unit files" are stored in 2 different directories.  One location is reserved for the default configurations as shipped by Red Hat and the other is for customization by the local administrators.

  * Red Hat unit files:    /usr/lib/systemd/system/...
  * Customizations:        /etc/systemd/system/...

=== Targets
systemd has a concept similar to SysV init runlevels, called targets.  systemd will boot to the “default target” which can be configured using the systemctl set-default command.  Some common targets and their equivalent SysV runlevels are:

  * multi-user.target == runlevel 3
  * graphical.target == runlevel 5

Let's view the current default target.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl get-default*

multi-user.target
----

=== Services
As mentioned above, systemd has another concept called a service.  A service is a type of unit which defines the traditional daemon or process.  Now let us look at what services are running on the system:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl -t service*

UNIT                               LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION                     
auditd.service                     loaded active running Security Auditing Service       
chronyd.service                    loaded active running NTP client/server               
crond.service                      loaded active running Command Scheduler               
dbus.service                       loaded active running D-Bus System Message Bus        
dracut-shutdown.service            loaded active exited  Restore /run/initramfs on s
firewalld.service                  loaded active running firewalld - dynamic firewal
...<output truncated>...
----

Next let's view all of the services available (ie: everything installed, running or not) on the system. The following command is similar to the older chkconfig --list as it will show both enabled and disabled services:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl list-unit-files -t service*

UNIT FILE                                   STATE   
arp-ethers.service                          disabled
auditd.service                              enabled 
autovt@.service                             enabled 
blk-availability.service                    disabled
chrony-dnssrv@.service                      static  
chrony-wait.service                         disabled
chronyd.service                             enabled 
...<output truncated>...
----

The state will  be enabled, disabled, static, or masked.  Static indicates that the unit file does not contain an "install" section used to enable the unit.  In this case, the unit typically performs a one-off action or is used as a dependency of another unit and should not be run by itself.

== Example : LAMP Stack

=== Install Packages

Now that we have a good idea of what’s installed on our system, let’s get a basic lamp stack up and running.  If you prefer not to type all of these commands, there is a workshop script below to save you some time.

Let us install some packages.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *yum install -y httpd mariadb-server mariadb*

...snip ...
Package httpd-2.4.37-16.module+el8.1.0+4134+e6bad0ed.x86_64 is already installed.
Package mariadb-server-3:10.3.17-1.module+el8.1.0+3974+90eded84.x86_64 is already installe
d.
Package mariadb-3:10.3.17-1.module+el8.1.0+3974+90eded84.x86_64 is already installed.
Dependencies resolved.
Nothing to do.
Complete!
----

=== Enable Services

Now it's time to enable the relevant system services.

NOTE: The "enable --now" syntax was introduced in a recent release of RHEL 7 and of course now in RHEL 8.  It allows for permanently enabling as well as immediately starting services in a single command.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl enable --now httpd mariadb*

Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/mysqld.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mariadb.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service.
----

Now let's check the status.  You should see two separate sections in the output, one for httpd and one for mariadb.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl status httpd mariadb*

● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-05-01 21:37:54 EDT; 12s ago
     Docs: man:httpd.service(8)
 Main PID: 5135 (httpd)
   Status: "Running, listening on: port 80"
    Tasks: 213 (limit: 24007)
   Memory: 26.5M
   CGroup: /system.slice/httpd.service
           ├─5135 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
           ├─5163 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
        ...<output truncated>...
----

=== Enable Firewall

Last but not least, you need to enable a firewall port.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *firewall-cmd --add-service=http*

success
----

So as promised, here is a workshop script that performs all of the above steps.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *workshop-systemd-lamp.sh*
----

=== Customize Services

systemd controls more than daemons or services. For this lab, we will primarily be working with service units but it's important to know that systemd is handling the dependencies between other types: sockets, timers, mounts, swap, slices, etc.

Unit files are stored in one of three places:

  * '/usr/lib/systemd/system' - default configs that ship with the RHEL and are updated by regular maintenance
  * '/etc/systemd/system' - custom configs that persist and replace (or augment) default configs
  * '/run/systemd/system' - runtime changes that won't persist

While the defaults for unit files won’t need to be altered most of the time, there will be circumstances where changing the defaults is quite beneficial. These could include hardware or software watchdog monitoring, tunings, resource management, or many other reasons.

Create a drop-in configuration file to extend the default httpd.service unit

==== Modify httpd

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *workshop-systemd-httpdconfig.sh*

Contents of /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/50-httpd.conf
[Service]
Restart=always
OOMScoreAdjust=-1000
----

OOMScoreAdjust is used by the Kernel's Out Of Memory killer and is an  integer between -1000 (to disable OOM killing for this process) and 1000 (to make killing of this process under memory pressure very likely).  

Notify systemd of the changes.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl daemon-reload*
----

==== Modify mariadb

Similar to what you did in the last step, extend the mariadb.service unit with Restart=always. 

This time we'll use systemctl to create the drop-in and notify systemd of the changes.

`systemctl edit` allows inserting the content for the drop-in and also handles the `systemctl daemon-reload` automatically.

.[root@node1]#
[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl edit mariadb*
----

.Type the following using the editor:
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
[Service]
Restart=always
----

Save and quit the editor, and view the unit

`systemctl cat` is a quick and easy way to view the contents of a unit & and it's drop-ins.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl cat mariadb*

...snip...
# Restart crashed server only, on-failure would also restart, for example, when
# my.cnf contains unknown option
Restart=on-abort
RestartSec=5s

UMask=007

# Give a reasonable amount of time for the server to start up/shut down
TimeoutSec=300

# Place temp files in a secure directory, not /tmp
PrivateTmp=true

# /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
Restart=always
----

=== Verify

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *systemctl status httpd*

● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
  Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d

   Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-05-01 21:37:54 EDT; 11min ago

           ├─5135 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
           ├─5163 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
----

Notice that systemctl status displays that the unit has been extended with a drop-in file.
