= BPF Tracing - Observability of System Performance

== Overview

eBPF (The Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is an in-kernel virtual machine that allows code execution in the kernel space, in a restricted sandbox environment with access to a limited set of functions. There are numerous components shipped by Red Hat that utilize the eBPF virtual machine. Each component is in a different development phase, and thus not all components are currently fully supported. Those that are not supported are available as a *Technology Preview* and are not intended for production use.For information on Red Hat scope of support for Technology Preview features, see: link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

In this unit, we will be focusing on the kernel tracing offering shipped as bcc-tools (BPF Compiler Collection Tools). There are just over 100 tools shipped in this package. A few things of note:

     * All of these tools live in `/usr/share/bcc/tools`.
     * These tools must run as the root user as any eBPF program can read kernel data. As such, injecting eBPF bytecode as a regular user is not allowed in RHEL 8.
     * Each tool has a man page to view the man page, run `man <tool name>`. These man pages include descriptions of the tools, provide the options that can be called and have information on the expected overhead of the specific tool.

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will primarily be using the host `node2` as user `root`.  However, these exercises do REQUIRE a second terminal session to run commands on other hosts.  Please pay careful attention to what commands to run on different hosts.

TIP: Now is a great time to use the multi session capability of *tmux*.  Use `Ctrl-b "` to create another session with a split screen.  Cycle the active session back and forth with `CTRL-b n` (next) and `CTRL-b p` (previous).

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node2`.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *ssh node2*
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your priviledges.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo -i*
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *workshop-ebpf-checkhost.sh*
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Installation

Start by installing the *BPF Compiler Collection* (bcc-tools) and kernel-devel packages for the installed kernel:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *yum install bcc-tools kernel-devel-$(uname -r) -y*
----

Now, we have a lot of interesting tools installed in /usr/share/bcc/tools along with accompanying man pages.





== bcc-tools: tcplife

The `tcplife` tool monitors tcp connections on the system and measures the amount of time that they've been open, the local and remote ports involved in the connection and the amount of data transferred and received in kilobytes.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# */usr/share/bcc/tools/tcplife*

PID   COMM       LADDR           LPORT RADDR           RPORT TX_KB RX_KB MS
----

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal

In your second terminal, establish yourself as described below and then run the following command:

  * host: *bastion*
  * user: *root*

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *ssh node2.example.com "sudo workshop-ebpf-rootkit.sh"*
----

This command should run for about 10 seconds and then exit.  

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

In the `tcplife` terminal, you should now see output similar to:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
PID   COMM       LADDR           LPORT RADDR           RPORT TX_KB RX_KB MS

----

Doing the math with my numbers above, my session was open for about 9 seconds and was initiated by IP 10.0.0.10, the bastion.

In the `tcplife` terminal, issue a Ctrl-C and this will return you to a prompt.





== bcc-tools: execsnoop

The `execsnoop` script monitors all calls to execve() and catches all processes that follow the fork->exec sequence, as well as processes that re-exec() themselves. Processes that fork() but do not exec() won't be caught by this script.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

Continuing on host `node2`, to run `execsnoop` as follows:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# */usr/share/bcc/tools/execsnoop*

PCOMM            PID    PPID   RET ARGS

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal

In your second terminal, establish yourself as described below and then run the following command:

  * host: *bastion*
  * user: *root*

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *ssh node2.example.com "sudo workshop-ebpf-rootkit.sh"*
----

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

In the `execsnoop` terminal, you should see output similar to:

----

This shows you all the processes that ran exec() during that ssh login, their PID, their parent PID, their return code, and the arguments that were sent to the process. You could keep monitoring this for quite some time to catch potential bad actors on the system.

In the `execsnoop` terminal, issue a Ctrl-C and this will return you to a prompt.





== bcc-tools: mountsnoop

Similar in nature to `execsnoop`, `mountsnoop` traces the mount() and umount() syscalls which show processes that are attempting to mount (or unmount) filesystems.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# */usr/share/bcc/tools/mountsnoop*

COMM             PID     TID     MNT_NS      CALL
----

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal

*PAY ATTENTION!!! USING A DIFFERENT HOST*

In your second terminal, establish yourself as described below and then run the following command:

  * host: *node2*
  * user: *root*

Let's try to unmount a mount that we know cannot be unmounted. For this, we'll pick the root filesystem '/'.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *umount /*

umount: /: target is busy.
----

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

Taking a look at the terminal running `mountsnoop`, we see:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
umount           20001   20001   4026531840  umount("/", 0x0) = -EBUSY
----

This shows us that the mount is busy and cannot be unmounted.

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal

Now let's try to unmount a filesystem that we should be able to unmount.  But before doing so, look at the mount options to ensure we can restore it correctly.  On `node2` run the following:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *grep /dev/shm /proc/mounts*

tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs *rw,seclabel,nosuid,nodev,relatime* 0 0
----

Now proceed to umount `/dev/shm` on `node2`

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *umount /dev/shm*
----

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

Back to the `mountsnoop` terminal and you should see the following:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
umount           20003   20003   4026531840  umount("/dev/shm", 0x0) = 0
----

The umount command succeeded. 

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal

Proceed to restore the /dev/shm mount as follows:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *mount -t tmpfs -o rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,seclabel tmpfs /dev/shm*
----

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

Finally, back to the `mountsnoop` terminal and you should see the following:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
mount            20004   20004   4026531840  mount("tmpfs", "/dev/shm", "tmpfs", MS_NOSUID|MS_NODEV|MS_NOEXEC|MS_SYNCHRONOUS|MS_DIRSYNC|MS_NOATIME|MS_NODIRATIME|MS_MOVE|MS_REC|MS_UNBINDABLE|MS_SLAVE|MS_SHARED|MS_I_VERSION|MS_STRICTATIME|MS_LAZYTIME|MS_NOUSER|0x7f2b30000000, "") = 0
----

This shows us that the mount succeeded and all the options that were passed into the system call.

As you can see, the `mountsnoop` tool is very useful for seeing what processes are calling the mount and umount system calls and what the results of those calls are.

In the `mountsnoop` terminal, issue a Ctrl-C and this will return you to a prompt.





== bcc-tools: xfsslower

WARNING: Please verify the filesystem your host is using with the command `df -T /`.  If your host is configured with ext4, then substitute the command `ext4slower` in place of `xfsslower`.

The purpose of the `xfsslower` tool (also `ext4slower` and `nfsslower`) is to show you filesystem operations slower than  a particular threshold, that defaults to 10ms. It traces reads, writes, opens, and syncs and then prints out the timestamp of the operation, the process name, the ID, the type of operation, the file offset in kilobytes, the latency of the I/O measured from when it was issued by VFS to the filesystem to when it was completed, and finally, the filename being operated on.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# */usr/share/bcc/tools/xfsslower*

Tracing xfs operations slower than 10 ms
TIME     COMM           PID    T BYTES   OFF_KB   LAT(ms) FILENAME
----

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal

In your second terminal, establish yourself as described below and then run the following command:

  * host: *node2*
  * user: *root*

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *dd if=/dev/urandom of=bigfile bs=1024 count=20000*
----

This writes out a 20M file called bigfile and should not register on your `xfsslower` window.

Now, let's execute the above command in a for loop so that we get more I/O going in parallel:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *for i in $(seq 1 10); do dd if=/dev/urandom of=bigfile$i bs=1024 count=20000 & done*
----

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

Now you should see similar output in your `xfsslower` window:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]

So we can see that when writing these files in parallel, we have xfs operations taking longer than 10ms to complete.

In the `xfsslower` terminal, issue a Ctrl-C and this will return you to a prompt.





== bcc-tools: cachestat

The `cachestat` tool traces kernel page cache functions and prints every five second summaries to aid you in workload characterization.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# */usr/share/bcc/tools/cachestat*

   TOTAL   MISSES     HITS  DIRTIES   BUFFERS_MB  CACHED_MB
----

[discrete]
==== Secondary Terminal

In your second terminal, establish yourself as described below and then run the following command:

  * host: *node2*
  * user: *root*

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches*
# *for i in $(seq 1 10); do dd if=/dev/urandom of=bigfile$i bs=1024 count=20000 & done*
----

This flushes the cache and then runs a series of `dd` commands to create some I/O.

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

In the `cachestat` window, you should output similar to:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
   TOTAL   MISSES     HITS  DIRTIES   BUFFERS_MB  CACHED_MB
       0        0        0        0            0        154
   14773      901    13872    44133            1        200
----

This shows that we had 901 page cache misses during a five second period while running the above loop, but during that same second, there were 9,821 hits, indicating great performance from the page cache.

In the `cachestat` terminal, issue a Ctrl-C and this will return you to a prompt.





== bcc-tools: trace

This tool is a swiss army knife allowing you to specify functions to trace and messages to be printed when certain conditions are met. You can read more about this by running:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *man 8 trace*
----

Let's do a simple trace in which we will dynamically trace the do_sys_open() kernel function and print the names of the files opened. 

[discrete]
==== Primary Terminal

To run this tool, execute the following and give it a couple of seconds to get set up:

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]

Go to the terminal with `trace` running and issue a Ctrl-C. This will end the process and return you to the command line. 

You may also now type `exit` in one of your tmux panes to return to having just one pane visible.

There is a lot more that you can do with this tool when you actually need to start tracing what is getting passed into kernel functions and what is being returned by those kernel functions.
