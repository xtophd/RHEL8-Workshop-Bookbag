= Workshop Preparation (DO THIS FIRST!)

== Sign-On to *bastion* host

Using the connection information and credentials provided by the instructor, get yourselves signed into your bastion session.

== Invoke *tmux* 

*tmux* is a very handy utilty for terminal session management.  If for any reason you lose connectivity or your session is terminated, *tmux* will preserve your session and allow you to reconnect.  There are MANY other features provided by this utility.  Some of them are listed in the primary document section titled *Quick Overview of tmux*.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *tmux*
----

== Become the root user

In order to execute the environment preparation, we need to become the administrative user 'root'.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo -i*
----


== Only with Explicit Instructions

WARNING: It is likely that your instructor (or the automated deployment system) has already performed these steps.  Do not replace, update or overwrite the configuration unless you are directed to do so.

Click on the commands below to expose steps to perform each action.  Remember, only do this if explicitly asked to do so.

.Commands to clone workshop from source
[%collapsible,bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
====
# cd ~

# git clone https://github.com/xtophd/RHEL8-Workshop

# git branch <branch-name>

.Commands to configure the workshop
[%collapsible,bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
====
# cd ~/RHEL8-Workshop

# cp ./sample-configs/[depoyment-type]/* ./config

== Run the Prep Script

NOTE: If you run the deployment playbooks from the web console shell, you will be disconnected and have to sign in again.  If you used tmux, you can easily recover your shell with 'tmux a'

Now we will run the playbooks that will set up all of the workshop exercises.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
cd ~/RHEL8-Workshop

./rhel8-workshop.sh all
----

The preparation script will run for approximately 5 to 7 minutes on a fresh deployment.

== Conclusion

The set up of the RHEL 8 Workshop should now be complete.  A couple of remaining words of advice:

1.  Some exercises are dependant on the successful completion of other exercises.  Those dependencies will be noted.
2.  Pay attention to which user-id (login) to use
3.  Pay attention to which host to use
4.  There is an exam at the conclusion of the workshop... #notreally
