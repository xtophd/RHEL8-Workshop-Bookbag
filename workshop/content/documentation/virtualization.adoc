= Virtualization Management

NOTE: If you are using the web-console and do not see "Virtual Machines" in the menu, chances are that you need to sign-out and sign-in again.

Provided your hardware is reasonably modern, chances are that it supports virtualization.  This unit introduces simple virtualization management using kvm and libvirt.  You will learn how to:

    * Install additional necessary software
    * Enable necessary system services and firewall ports
    * Use the command line to create and manage a virtual machine
    * Use the web console (cockpit) to create and manage a virtual machine

== Getting Started

Starting on the host *workstation*, just make sure you're the root user.  All exercises will be performed on the *workstation* host.

.[root@workstation]#
----
id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
cheat-virt-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

=== Requirements

First we need to ensure the system being used supports either:

    * Intel VT-x and Intel 64 virtualization extensions
    * AMD-V and the AMD64 virtualization extensions

This is done with the following simple commands.

You can start by examining the CPU flags (capabilities) advertised by your system.

.[root@workstation]#
----
grep -E 'svm|vmx' /proc/cpuinfo
----

You are looking for either the Intel flag (vtx) or the AMD flag (svm).  A more sophisticated command makes it a little easier to determine.

.[root@workstation]#
----
if grep -qE 'svm|vmx' /proc/cpuinfo ; then echo "Virt Supported" ; else echo "*WARN* Virt NOT Supported"; fi
----

After you install all the required software, there are some additional tools to provide more detailed reporting on system capabilities.

=== Installation

NOTE: Please note that all software has been pre-installed and configured.  These steps are provided as reference material.

System needs to be configure with access to the following repos:

  * rhel-8-baseos-rpms
  * rhel-8-appstream-rpms

.[root@workstation]#
----
yum install -y qemu-kvm libvirt virt-install libvirt-client libguestfs-tools cockpit-machines lorax-composer composer-cli cockpit-composer
----

=== Enable System Services

NOTE: Please note that all software has been pre-installed and configured.  These steps are provided as reference material.

If for some reason the webconsole is not enabled, please visit that unit for instructions on installing and configuring webconsole.

To enable the necessary services for this unit:

.[root@workstation]#
----
systemctl enable lorax-composer libvirtd

systemctl start lorax-composer libvirtd
----

=== Verify Virtualization Host Status

One simple command checks various hardware and software configurations for support of virtualization.

.[root@workstation]#
----
virt-host-validate
----

----
  QEMU: Checking for hardware virtualization                                 : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/kvm exists                                   : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/kvm is accessible                            : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/vhost-net exists                             : PASS
  QEMU: Checking if device /dev/net/tun exists                               : PASS
  QEMU: Checking for cgroup 'cpu' controller support                         : PASS
  QEMU: Checking for cgroup 'cpuacct' controller support                     : PASS
  QEMU: Checking for cgroup 'cpuset' controller support                      : PASS
  QEMU: Checking for cgroup 'memory' controller support                      : PASS
  QEMU: Checking for cgroup 'devices' controller support                     : PASS
  QEMU: Checking for cgroup 'blkio' controller support                       : PASS
  QEMU: Checking for device assignment IOMMU support                         : WARN (No ACPI IVRS table found, IOMMU either disabled in BIOS or not supported by this hardware platform)

== Image Builder

=== Overview

Red Hat provides pre-made images of RHEL for use as virtual machines.  This come in a QCOW2 format.

However, in order to access them for download one needs to have an active Red Hat Enterprise Linux entitlement.  An obvious alternative to downloading an image is to make one.  There are 2 solutions to creating a VM image from scratch:

  * Provision one (via bootable ISO or PXE)
  * Magically build an image using the Lorax `Image Builder`

`Image Builder` is a set of tools to create custom RHEL images in a variety of formats for compatibility with major cloud providers and virtualization technologies available.  Meaning, you can specify the target platfrom for you vm and create an appropriate image for VMWare, AWS, Openstack, KVM, etc...

We are only going to leverage an existing blueprint, but please note that blueprints are easy to create, extend and customize for your unique requirements.

=== List Blueprints

.[root@workstation]#
----
composer-cli blueprints list
----

----
example-atlas
example-development
example-http-server
----

A nice quick way to determine if the local `Image Builder` can resolve all dependencies for the blueprint is to run  it thorugh a `depsolve`.  Here you can also see a full list of rpms that will be installed on the image.

.[root@workstation]#
----
composer-cli blueprints depsolve example-http-server
----

----
blueprint: example-http-server v0.0.1
    acl-2.2.53-1.el8.x86_64
    apr-1.6.3-9.el8.x86_64
    apr-util-1.6.1-6.el8.x86_64
    audit-libs-3.0-0.13.20190507gitf58ec40.el8.x86_64
    basesystem-11-5.el8.noarch
    bash-4.4.19-10.el8.x86_64
    brotli-1.0.6-1.el8.x86_64
    bzip2-libs-1.0.6-26.el8.x86_64
    ca-certificates-2018.2.24-6.el8.noarch
    chkconfig-1.11-1.el8.x86_64
    coreutils-8.30-6.el8.x86_64
...
----


=== Compose a Blueprint

We are going to leverage the `example-http-server` for our purposes.

.[root@workstation]#
----
composer-cli compose start example-http-server qcow2
----

----
Compose 812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 added to the queue
----

.[root@workstation]#
----
composer-cli compose status
----

.[root@workstation]#
----
composer-cli compose list
----

It may take a few minutes, but eventually you should see a "FINISHED" status

----
812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 FINISHED example-http-server 0.0.1 qcow2
----

== Deploy A Virtual-Machine with 'virt-install'

Now you are ready to leverage the example-http-server and deploy the VM with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

=== Retrieve a QCOW Image

First we need to grab a copy of the image and put it in the right place for our platform.

----
cd /var/lib/libvirt/images

composer-cli compose image 812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8

mv *.qcow2 vmguest.qcow2
----

=== Modify the QCOW Image

Now you need to set a root password in the image

----
virt-customize -a vmguest.qcow2 --root-password password:redhat --uninstall cloud-init
----

=== Deploy the QCOW Image

Finally it's time to launch the VM

----
virt-install \
  --import \
  --name vmguest \
  --memory 2048 \
  --vcpus 1 \
  --disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/vmguest.qcow2 \
  --graphics vnc \
  --noautoconsole\
  --os-variant rhel8.1
----

=== Additional CLI Commands

Some additional simple virtual machine management commands

----
virsh list
virsh list --all

virsh start vmguest
virsh shutdown vmguest
----

== Explore VM Management with 'Web-Console'

From the menu, select the Machines tab.  You will notice that the interface is still pretty rudimentary when compared the Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) , but one critical feature is available: the console!

Take some time to explore the capabilities of the Web-Console Machines webui.

Log in to your client (user:root password:redhat) and poke around.  The VM is on a private network and not accessbile from the internet.  You will only be able to access from the webconsole.

== Shutdown Virtual Machines

WARN: It is IMPORTANT to stop or delete the deployed VMs

Using either the CLI (or the Web-Console), be sure to shutdown the VM(s) you deployed to ensure additional workshop exercises perform reasonably.

----
virsh list --all

virsh shutdown vmguest
