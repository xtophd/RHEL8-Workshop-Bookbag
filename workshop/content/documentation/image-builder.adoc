= Image Builder

WARN: You must complete the Virtualization unit before proceeding.

INFO: If you are using the web-console and do not see "Virtual Machines" or the "Image Builder" icon in the menus, chances are that you need to sign-out and sign-in again.

== Getting Started

Starting on the host *bastion.example.com*, just make sure you're the root user.

.[root@bastion]#
----
id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

.[root@bastion ~]#
----
workshop-imagebuilder-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

=== Installation

Assuming that the web-console is already installed and enabled, proceed to install the packages for Image Builder.

----
yum install -y lorax-composer composer-cli cockpit-composer
----

=== Enable System Services

----
# systemctl enable lorax-composer.socket
# systemctl start lorax-composer

== Create a QCOW Image

=== Create Blueprint

=== Create Image

=== Download Image

== Deploy the QCOW Image

=== Modify the Image

Now you need to set a root password in the image

----
virt-customize -a vmguest-02.qcow2 --root-password password:redhat --uninstall cloud-init
----

=== Deploy the Image

Finally it's time to launch the VM

----
virt-install \
  --import \
  --name vmguest-01 \
  --memory 2048 \
  --vcpus 1 \
  --disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.1-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 \
  --graphics vnc \
  --noautoconsole\
  --os-variant rhel8.1

== Shutdown Virtual Machines

WARN: It is IMPORTANT to stop or delete the deployed VMs
