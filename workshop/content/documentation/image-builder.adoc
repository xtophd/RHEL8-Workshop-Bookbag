= Image Builder

== Overview

When installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux from scratch, the traditional methods are:

  * Use the DVD ISO
  * Use the BOOT ISO with network accessible repos 
  * Use the pre-built KVM Guest images (qcow2)

Leveraging additional tools and services (ie: pxe, dhcp, kickstart, ansible automation, ipmi, 
redfish, etc...) the process can be heavily automated and turned into a completely hands-free task.
We have doing this for decades.

Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, now there is a new method for creating RHEL images to add 
to your toolbox: *Image Builder*.

*Image Builder* is a collection of tools that create custom RHEL images in a variety of formats for 
compatibility with major cloud providers and virtualization technologies.  Meaning, you can design 
an OS blueprint and then specify the target platfrom to create an appropriate image (ie: VMWare, 
AWS, Openstack, KVM, etc...).

IMPORTANT: As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3, the osbuild-composer backend replaces lorax-composer and provides more reliable backend and more predictable output images.

NOTE: Cross-distribution image building, such as building a CentOS image on RHEL is not supported.

NOTE: You CAN create images of multiple RHEL minor releases that are different from the host (ex: RHEL 8.4, RHEL 8.5) but to do so requires additional repo configurations which are not available in this workshop environment.

NOTE: Internet connectivity is not a prerequisite, however Image Builder is configured to connect to Red Hat CDN by default and must modified to work in an isolated environment.

== Installation and Configuration

Install the required packages - this will pull in several Python related dependencies.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*yum install -y osbuild-composer composer-cli*
----

To ensure everything is stopped.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*systemctl stop osbuild-composer.socket*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*systemctl stop osbuild-worker@.service.d osbuild-worker@1.service osbuild-composer.service*
----

Depending on the environment the workshop is running in, we probably need to adjust
the available repos by adding a few custom options.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*cp /usr/local/etc/osbuild-config.json /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-8.json*
----

Next we need to enable and start the `osbuild-composer.socket` service

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*systemctl enable --now osbuild-composer.socket*
----

Finally check the service status.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*systemctl status osbuild-composer.socket*
----

== Create a Blueprint

Blueprints are defined by a TOML configuration file.  A sample has been provided to get us started with a very basic definition.


[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*cat /usr/local/etc/osbuild-sample.toml*
----

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
name = "sample-webserver"
description = "standard apache httpd webserver"
version = "0.0.1"

[customizations.services]
enabled = ["httpd"]

[[modules]]
version = "2.4.*"
name = "httpd"

[[modules]]
version = "2.4.*"
name = "mod_ssl"

[[packages]]
version = "*"
name = "openssh-server"

[[packages]]
version = "*"
name = "rsync"
----

Looking over the bludprint, it should be apparent that this image blueprint builds on a standard RHEL base by:

    * enabling the httpd service 
    * adding a few packages 

Now we need to push the blueprint to our image builder catalog.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli blueprints push /usr/local/etc/osbuild-sample.toml*
----


== List Blueprints

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli blueprints list*
----

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
sample-webserver
----

A nice quick way to determine if the local `Image Builder` can resolve all dependencies for the blueprint is to run  it thorugh a `depsolve`.  Here you can also see a full list of rpms that will be installed on the image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli blueprints depsolve sample-webserver*
----

If everything is in order, you output should look something like this.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
blueprint: sample-webserver v0.0.1
    acl-2.2.53-1.el8.x86_64
    audit-libs-3.0-0.17.20191104git1c2f876.el8.x86_64
    basesystem-11-5.el8.noarch
    bash-4.4.19-14.el8.x86_64
    brotli-1.0.6-3.el8.x86_64
    bzip2-libs-1.0.6-26.el8.x86_64
    ca-certificates-2020.2.41-80.0.el8_2.noarch
    chkconfig-1.13-2.el8.x86_64
    coreutils-8.30-8.el8.x86_64
...SNIP...
----

If you see errors or packages that can not be resolved, this is likely a problem with the osbuild repo configuration(s).  Let your instructor know and hopefully this can be fixed.

== Compose a Blueprint

We are now ready to compose the blueprint into an image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose start sample-webserver qcow2*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
Compose 812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 added to the queue
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose status*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose list*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 *FINISHED* sample-webserver 0.0.1 qcow2
----

It may take a few minutes, but eventually you should see a "FINISHED" status



== Retrieve the QCOW Image

We need to grab a copy of the image and put it in the right place for our platform.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*cd /var/lib/libvirt/images*
----

Take a moment to identify the UUID of the created image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose list*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 *FINISHED* sample-webserver 0.0.1 qcow2
----

Here is a helpful way to store the last FINISHED image UUID to an environment variable.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*export IMAGE_UUID=$(composer-cli compose list | grep -m 1 FINISHED | awk '{print $1}')*
----

Now use the UUID from your ouput to extract the QCOW image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose image $IMAGE_UUID*
----

Finally you can rename it to something a little more convinient

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*mv $IMAGE_UUID-disk.qcow2 vmguest.qcow2*
----

=== Modify the QCOW Image

Now you need to set a root password in the image

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*virt-customize -a vmguest.qcow2 \
                --hostname vmguest \
                --root-password password:redhat \
                --uninstall cloud-init*
----

Your image is now ready for deployment.

In the next unit, we will tackle how to utilize the native virtualization technology included with RHEL to launch your custom built image.
