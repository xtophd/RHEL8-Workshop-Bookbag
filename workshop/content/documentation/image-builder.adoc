= Image Builder

== Overview

When installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux from scratch, the traditional methods are:

  * Use the DVD ISO
  * Use the BOOT ISO with network accessible repos 
  * Use the pre-built KVM Guest images (qcow2)

Leveraging additional tools and services (ie: pxe, dhcp, kickstart, ansible automation, ipmi, 
redfish, etc...) the process can be heavily automated and turned into a completely hands-free task.
We have doing this for decades.

Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, now there is a new method for creating RHEL images to add 
to your toolbox: *Image Builder*.

*Image Builder* is a collection of tools that create custom RHEL images in a variety of formats for 
compatibility with major cloud providers and virtualization technologies.  Meaning, you can design 
an OS blueprint and then specify the target platfrom to create an appropriate image (ie: VMWare, 
AWS, Openstack, KVM, etc...).

IMPORTANT: As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3, the osbuild-composer backend replaces lorax-composer and provides more reliable backend and more predictable output images.

NOTE: Cross-distribution image building, such as building a CentOS image on RHEL is not supported.

NOTE: You CAN create images of multiple RHEL minor releases that are different from the host (ex: RHEL 8.4, RHEL 8.5) with osbuild-composer but to doing so requires additional repo configurations which are not available in this workshop environment.

NOTE: Internet connectivity is not a prerequisite, however Image Builder is configured to connect to Red Hat CDN by default and must modified to work in an isolated environment or when connected to a Red Hat Satellite server.

== Installation and Configuration

NOTE: As mentioned above, when RHEL 8.3 was released the *Image Builder* backend was replaced with another toolset called 'osbuild'.  
At the time of the design and validation of this lab, the feature set and configuration options of 'osbuild' are not compatible with 
this workshop environment.  Thus, we will stick with the lorax backend for now but other than the installation and setup the 
operational commands remain the same.

To prevent possible installation conflicts (overrides), we specifically exclude 'osbuild' when installing the lorax-composer.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*yum install --exclude=osbuild* -y lorax-composer composer-cli libguestfs-tools*
----

Ensure everything is stopped.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*systemctl stop lorax-composer.socket*
----

Next we need to enable and start the `lorax-composer.socket` service

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*systemctl enable --now lorax-composer.socket*
----

Finally check the service status.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*systemctl status lorax-composer.socket*
----

== Create a Blueprint

Blueprints are defined by a TOML configuration file.  A sample has been provided to get us started with a very basic definition.


[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*cat /usr/local/etc/imagebuilder-sample.toml*
----

[bash,options="nowrap"]
----
name = "sample-webserver"
description = "standard apache httpd webserver"
version = "0.0.1"

[customizations.services]
enabled = ["httpd"]

[[modules]]
version = "2.4.*"
name = "httpd"

[[modules]]
version = "2.4.*"
name = "mod_ssl"

[[packages]]
version = "*"
name = "openssh-server"

[[packages]]
version = "*"
name = "rsync"
----

Looking over the bludprint, it should be apparent that this image blueprint builds on a standard RHEL base by:

    * enabling the httpd service 
    * adding a few packages 

Now we need to push the blueprint to our image builder catalog.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli blueprints push /usr/local/etc/imagebuilder-sample.toml*
----


== List Blueprints

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli blueprints list*
----

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
example-atlas
example-development
example-http-server
sample-webserver
----

A nice quick way to determine if the local `Image Builder` can resolve all dependencies for the blueprint is to run  it thorugh a `depsolve`.  Here you can also see a full list of rpms that will be installed on the image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli blueprints depsolve sample-webserver*
----

If everything is in order, you output should look something like this.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
blueprint: sample-webserver v0.0.1
    acl-2.2.53-1.el8.x86_64
    audit-libs-3.0-0.17.20191104git1c2f876.el8.x86_64
    basesystem-11-5.el8.noarch
    bash-4.4.19-14.el8.x86_64
    brotli-1.0.6-3.el8.x86_64
    bzip2-libs-1.0.6-26.el8.x86_64
    ca-certificates-2020.2.41-80.0.el8_2.noarch
    chkconfig-1.13-2.el8.x86_64
    coreutils-8.30-8.el8.x86_64
...SNIP...
----

If you see errors or packages that can not be resolved, this is likely a problem with the osbuild repo configuration(s).  Let your instructor know and hopefully this can be fixed.

== Compose a Blueprint

We are now ready to compose the blueprint into an image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose start sample-webserver qcow2*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
Compose 812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 added to the queue
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose status*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose list*
----

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 *FINISHED* sample-webserver 0.0.1 qcow2
----

It may take a few minutes, but eventually you should see a "FINISHED" status



== Retrieve the QCOW Image

We need to grab a copy of the image and put it in the right place for our platform.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*cd /var/lib/libvirt/images*
----

Take a moment to identify the UUID of the created image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose list*
----

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
812019dd-20e5-4528-a99b-09fbe47ca2d8 *FINISHED* sample-webserver 0.0.1 qcow2
----

Here is a helpful way to store the last FINISHED image UUID to an environment variable.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*export IMAGE_UUID=$(composer-cli compose list | grep -m 1 FINISHED | awk '{print $1}')*
----

Now use the UUID from your ouput to extract the QCOW image.

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*composer-cli compose image $IMAGE_UUID*
----

Finally you can rename it to something a little more convinient

[source,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}",role="copy"]
----
*mv $IMAGE_UUID-disk.qcow2 vmguest.qcow2*
----

== Conclusion

Minus a few customizations, your image is now ready for deployment.

The next unit covers the native virtualization technology included with RHEL 
and will utilize this image to deploy the sample-webserver.
