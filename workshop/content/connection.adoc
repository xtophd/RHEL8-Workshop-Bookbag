== Getting Started

WARNING: As an administrator, you are capable of ruining your environment.  We strongly encourage you 
to stick to the exercises as prescribed.  Recovery of your environment is unlikely due to limited time and resources.

NOTE: We only test with Firefox and/or Google Chrome.  Your mileage will vary using MacOS Safari or Windows Explorer.

Exercises in this workshop require either:

  * shell access (via ssh)
  * web gui access (via web console)

You can use the convenient shell provided to the right of these instructions, or if you prefer you can use your preferred ssh client with the same connectivity info.  Your choice...

== Environment Description

Activities in this workshop are performed on virtual machines running in a public cloud.  Each attendee has received their own unique environment and will be provided administrator priviledges when needed.

There are 4 systems:

  * bastion - primary system and launch point to other hosts
  * node1
  * node2
  * node3
  * node4

The network domain is likely `example.com` but not necessarily so.  We expect most exercises and envionments will work by using the short hostnames.  So when asked to use `node1` for a unit:

  * ssh to `bastion` using the provided connection info 
  * and then `ssh node1`
